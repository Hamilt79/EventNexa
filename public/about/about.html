			EventNexa is a website crafted by three students at Miami University. <br>
			The website was crafted with the intention to bridge the gap between the physical and virtual world. <br>
			EventNexa allows users to post and view events, giving the opportunity for individuals to see what's going on in their respective locations. <br>
			By providing a platform for users to see what events are going on where we hope that this will promote individuals to attend such events. <br>
			In it's current stage the website is not secure and as such we reccomend not entering any sensitive information. <br>
			We hope you enjoy the website and utilize it to seek out like minded people with similiar interests to yourself. <br>
			Best wishes - The EventNexa team <br>
