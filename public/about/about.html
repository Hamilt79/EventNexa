			EventNexa is a website crafted from three students at Miami University. <br>
			The goal of EventNexa is to provide a platform that promotes human interaction. <br>
			EventNexa allows users to post events they are hosting as well as to join events other users have posted. <br>
			With each event a location is added as well as a time allowing all those interested to see when and what event is taking <br>
			place in various locations around the world. <br>
			By having this website readily avalaible we hope users will utilize it in order to meet new people whom have similiar <br> 
			interests, promoting human connection and to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical world. <br>
			It is important to note that in it's current development stage that this website is currently not secure. <br>
			As such we advise all users to not enter secure information but rather to craft unique login details to protect 
			themselves. <br>
